## Requirements
- Should Consume a public API
- Should include a router 
- Should consist of more than one page
- Should have semantically clean HTML
- Must be deployed online and accessible to the public.

## Overview

- We decided to randomly generate a character from the TV show and display the character on the page with details about that particular character as well as their image.

## Technologies used

- CSS
- Bulma

## Homepage 

The home page consists of three buttons: one chooses a female character, one chooses a male character and the third one randomly chooses any character. There is also a section which explains how to use the app.

## Character page
Once the user chooses their character, they are taken to a character page where they find the image and more details about that specific character.
