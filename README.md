# Random Morty API
Link to project https://random-morty.netlify.app/

## Brief
In this project we were asked to build a React application that consumes a public API. We decided on Rick & Morty API which we would request and display a random character depending on the user gender selection. This was a pair project which we had a week to complete. 

## Requirements
- Should Consume a public API
- Should include a router 
- Should consist of more than one page
- Should have semantically clean HTML
- Must be deployed online and accessible to the public.


## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bulma
- Javascript
- React
- Git

## Approach

We decided to randomly generate a character from the TV show and display the character on the page with details about that particular character as well as their image.

We used the react-router-dom Link elements to specify different genders. We used the following API link to fetch our data https://rickandmortyapi.com .

I was responsible for the Character.js page. I used the data from the response and used destructuring props to display the data on the page. For styling we used mostly Bulma as well as some CSS.

## Homepage 

The home page consists of three buttons: one chooses a female character, one chooses a male character and the third one randomly chooses any character. There is also a section which explains how to use the app.

## Character page
Once the user chooses their character, they are taken to a character page where they find the image and more details about that specific character.

## Wins 
- Being able to create and deploy a functional project
- Being able to meet our MVP goals
- Learning Bulma styling in this project
- Working in pairs and learning from others

## Bugs 
In the display character page, once you click on one button you cannot click on it again to get another character.
